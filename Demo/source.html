The field is largely dominated by populations of Ghanaian origin, who account for about 90 percent of the 10,000 coastal fishermen. They use large 25- to 50-foot (18- to 15-meter) pirogues fitted with outboard motors and are based in Abidjan or Grand-Bassam.'

In the dry season, the tall grasses that cover them take on a brown color — hence the name Chocolate Hills.',

The sixth continent is a unique observation point for atmospheric and climatic phenomena; its ancient ice, which trapped air when it was formed, contains evidence of the Earth’s climate as it has changed and developed over the past hundreds of thousand years.',

These carpets are traditionally woven with wool, a symbol of  protection and joy, sometimes combined with silk, cotton or camel or goat hair. The colours and patterns are typical of the regions where the carpets are made and it is in the High Atlas, up against where Marrakesh is situated, that the shades are warmest. The workforce is mainly feminine but also includes children.',
